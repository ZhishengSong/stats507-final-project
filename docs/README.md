# Documentation Hub

All long-form notes have been consolidated into the root-level `README.md`.  
Use the sections there for:

- Project overview and directory layout
- Experiment / result summaries
- Improvement roadmap and troubleshooting tips

Only lightweight assets (e.g. plots under `../results/plots`) should remain inside `docs/`.  
If you need to add new guidance, either update the root README directly or place a very short pointer here that links back to the relevant section.
