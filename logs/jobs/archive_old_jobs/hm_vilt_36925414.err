Disabling PyTorch because PyTorch >= 2.1 is required but found 2.0.1+cu118
None of PyTorch, TensorFlow >= 2.0, or Flax have been found. Models won't be available and only tokenizers, configuration and file/data utilities can be used.

While we do not expect major breaking changes, some APIs may still change according to user feedback. Please submit any feedback you may have in this issue: https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/6753, and you can also check out https://github.com/pytorch/vision/issues/7319 to learn more about the APIs that we suspect might involve future changes.

ViltModel requires the PyTorch library but it was not found in your environment. Check out the instructions on the
installation page: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/ and follow the ones that match your environment.
Please note that you may need to restart your runtime after installation.
